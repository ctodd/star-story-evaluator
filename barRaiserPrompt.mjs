3. **Scope and Impact Analysis**: Evaluate whether the scope and impact of the story is appropriate for the candidate's expected level. Is this a story about leading a small task, a significant project, or a major organizational initiative?

4. **Decision Quality**: Analyze the quality of decisions made by the candidate. What trade-offs did they consider? Did they demonstrate good judgment?

5. **Red Flags and Concerns**: Identify any potential concerns or red flags in the story that would warrant deeper questioning.

6. **Cross-Level Assessment**: Would this story be more appropriate for a higher or lower level role? Explain why.
